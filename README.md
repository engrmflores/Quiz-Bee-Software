# Quiz Bee Software

The skills, competence, and knowledge of students can be measured through its performance in competitions like quiz bee. To make it convenient, you are to design a software quiz bee that consists of the following: 
a.	The software contains the following menus (Easy, Average, and Difficult).
b.	You cannot proceed to the next round without passing the lower level.
c.	Each round has 5 questions each.
d.	The point system will be Easy Round (1 pt.), Average Round (3pts.), and Difficult Round (5pts.) 
e.	The total score will be viewed at the end of each round.
f.	At the end of the game, the total accumulated score will be displayed

The software design was constructed in the Microsoft Visual Studio environment. The graphical user interface consists of buttons, labels, and textboxes. These aforementioned tools that are utilized are manipulated through coding conditions following the programâ€™s concept accordingly.

The program is composed with by three categories presented through three buttons: Easy, Average & Hard. Each category has five questions that has four options: letters A, B, C, & D. After every round, the score is calculated accordingly. After all categories are already answered, the score is added up.

In light of this activity, I was able to execute the objective of this program through applying the various features and tools of software design. The conditions and exceptions were a little hard to figure out but through proper naming conventions and following the coding rules, the program is up and running.
